# Ratburger.org Code Base

[Ratburger.org](https://www.ratburger.org/) is an online community where a wide variety
of topics are discussed in a civil manner among an international membership whose
only common denominator is their dislike for the sewer that so many Internet
fora and comment sections have become.

Anyone can read all of the content at the site.  By joining, which is free, users can
write and publish their own posts and comment on the posts of others, and participate
in discussion groups on various topic and create their own new groups.  A chat room
is available for real-time conversations.  There are advertisements on the site.
Members whose behaviour is deemed not in keeping with the goals of the site may be
banned at the sole discretion of the administrators.

Ratburger.org is built upon the foundation of [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)
and [BuddyPress](https://buddypress.org/) with extended by a number of
freely available plug-ins to those packages and site-specific customisations.
