You're welcome to use this repository as the starting point for your own
online community site.  If you find and fix any bugs or make extensions
which might be useful for users or administrators, you're welcome to
submit them via a pull request for incorporation into the Ratburger
site and this repository.

The design goals for Ratburger are speed, reliability, minimalism,
and ease of use.  Consequently, the site deliberately eachews features
which require contacting dozens of other Web resources and downloading
hundreds of files to display a simple page.  These gimmicks may be
superficially attractive, but they result in frustratingly slow
page load times and render the site vulnerable to points of failure
all over the Web.  You're welcome to adorn your own site with such
frippery, but Ratburger isn't interested in it.
