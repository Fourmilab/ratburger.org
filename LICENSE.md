# Software Licenses

[Ratburger.org](https://www.ratburger.org/) is built upon a foundation of
open source software packages released under various
licenses.  The WordPress license is found in the file
[license.txt](https://github.com/Fourmilab/ratburger.org/blob/master/license.txt)
in the home directory of the repository.  Plug-in packages are in the
directory
[wp-content/plugins](https://github.com/Fourmilab/ratburger.org/tree/master/wp-content/plugins)
with each subdirectory containing the license under which it was released.  Local
modifications to these plug-ins are distributed under the same license as the
original plug-in.  Ratburger-specific plug-ins are in the public domain.

The Ratburger.org site uses a small number of proprietary plug-ins which are
not included in this repository.  The site will work without them, albeit
without the features they supply.
