Manage internal & external links: open in new window or tab, control nofollow, ugc, sponsored & noopener. SEO friendly.

== Description ==

**Manage all external & internal links on your site**. Control icons, nofollow, noopener, ugc (User Generated Content), sponsored and if links open in new window or new tab.

WP External Links plugin was completely rebuilt in v2 and has lots of new features, like noopener, ugc and sponsored values for rel; font icons, internal links options and full WPMU support.

= Features =
* Manage external and internal links 
* Open links in new window or tab
* Add follow or nofollow (for SEO)
* Add noopener and noreferrer (for security)
* Add ugc (User Generated Content) and sponsored values to rel (<a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2019/09/evolving-nofollow-new-ways-to-identify.html">Google announcement</a>)
* Add link icons (FontAwesome and Dashicons)
* Set other attributes like title and CSS classes
* Scan complete page (or just posts, comments, widgets)
* SEO friendly

= And more... =
* Network Settings (WPMU support)
* Use template tag to apply plugin settings on specific contents
* Set data-attribute to change how individual links will be treated
* Use built-in actions and filters to implement your specific needs

= Easy to use =
After activating you can set all options for external and internal links on the plugins admin page.

= On the fly =
The plugin filters the output and changes the links on the fly. The real contents (posts, pages, widget etcetera) will not be changed in the database.
When deactivating the plugin, all contents will be the same as it was before.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I want certain posts or pages to be ignored by the plugin. How? =

Just use the option "Skip pages or posts" under the tab "Exceptions".

For a more custom approach use the action `wpel_apply_settings`:
`add_action( 'wpel_apply_settings', function () {
    global $post;
    $ignored_post_ids = array( 1, 2, 4 );

    if ( in_array( $post->ID, $ignored_post_ids ) ) {
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}, 10 );`

Using this filter you can ignore any request, like certain category, archive etcetera.

= I want specific links to be ignored by the plugin. How? =

There's an option for ignoring links containing a certain class (under tab "Exceptions").

For a more flexible check on ignoring links you could use the filter `wpel_before_apply_link`:
`add_action( 'wpel_before_apply_link', function ( $link ) {
    // ignore links with class "some-cls"
    if ( $link->has_attr_value( 'class', 'some-cls' ) ) {
        $link->set_ignore();
    }
}, 10 );`


= How to create a redirect for external links? (f.e. affiliate links) =

Create redirect by using the `wpel_link` action. Add some code to functions.php of your theme, like:

`add_action( 'wpel_link', function ( $link ) {
    // check if link is an external links
    if ( $link->is_external() ) {
        // get current url
        $url = $link->get_attr( 'href' );

        // set redirect url
        $redirect_url = '//somedom.com?url='. urlencode( $url );
        $link->set_attr( 'href', $redirect_url );
    }
}, 10, 1 );`

= How to open external links in a new popup window? =

By adding this JavaScript code to your site:

`jQuery(function ($) {
    $('a[data-wpel-link="external"]').click(function (e) {
        // open link in popup window
        window.open($(this).attr('href'), '_blank', 'width=800, height=600');

        // stop default and other behaviour
        e.preventDefault();
        e.stopImmediatePropagation();
    });
});`

See more information on the [window.open() method](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_open.asp).

= How to add an confirm (or alert) when opening external links? =

Add this JavaScript code to your site:

`jQuery(function ($) {
    $('a[data-wpel-link="external"]').click(function (e) {
        if (!confirm('Are you sure you want to open this link?')) {
            // cancelled
            e.preventDefault();
            e.stopImmediatePropagation();
        }
    });
});`

= How to open PDF files in a new window? =

Use some JavaScript code for opening PDF files in a new window:

`jQuery(function ($) {
    $('a[href$=".pdf"]').prop('target', '_blank');
});`

= How to set another icon for secure sites (using https)? =

Use some CSS style to change the icon for secure sites using https:

`a[href^="https"] .wpel-icon:before {
  content: "\f023" !important;
}`

The code `\f023` refers to a dashicon or font awesome icon.

= I am a plugin developer and my plugin conflicts with WPEL. How can I solve the problem? =

If your plugin contains links it might be filtered by the WPEL plugin as well, causing a conflict.
Here are some suggestions on solving the problem:

1. Add `data-wpel-link="ignore"` to links that need to be ignored by WPEL plugin
1. Use `wpel_before_apply_link`-action to ignore your links (f.e. containing certain class or data-attribute)
1. Use `wpel_apply_settings`-filter to ignore complete post, pages, categories etc

2. Admin Settings Page
3. WPMU Network Settings Page


== Documentation ==

After activating you can set all options for external and internal links.

= Data attribute "data-wpel-link" =

Links being processed by this plugin will also contain the data-attribute `data-wpel-link`.
The plugin could set the value to `external`, `internal` or `exclude`, meaning how the
link was processed.

You can also set the data-attribute yourself. This way you can force how the plugin will process
certain links.

When you add the value `ignore`, the link will be completely ignored by the plugin:

`<a href="http://somedomain.com" data-wpel-link="ignore">Go to somedomain</a>`


= Action "wpel_link" =

Use this action to change the link object after all plugin settings have been applied.

`add_action( 'wpel_link', ( $link_object ) {
    if ( $link_object->is_external() ) {
        // get current url
        $url = $link_object->getAttribute( 'href' );

        // set redirect url
        $redirect_url = '//somedom.com?url='. urlencode( $url );
        $link_object->setAttribute( 'href', $redirect_url );
    }
}, 10, 1 );`

The link object is an instance of `WPEL_Link` class.

= Action hook "wpel_before_apply_link" =

Use this action to change the link object before the plugin settings will be applied on the link.
You can use this filter f.e. to ignore individual links from being processed. Or change dynamically how
they will be treated by this plugin.

`add_action( 'wpel_before_apply_link', function ( $link ) {
    // ignore links with class "some-cls"
    if ( $link->has_attr_value( 'class', 'some-cls' ) ) {
        $link->set_ignore();
    }

    // mark and treat links with class "ext-cls" as external link
    if ( $link->has_attr_value( 'class', 'ext-cls' ) ) {
        $link->set_external();
    }
}, 10 );`

= Filter hook "wpel_apply_settings" =

When filter returns false the plugin settings will not be applied. Can be used when f.e. certain posts or pages should be ignored by this plugin.

`add_filter( 'wpel_apply_settings', '__return_false' );`
