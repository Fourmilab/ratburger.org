Fixes the rotation of the images based on EXIF data

== Description ==
Fix Image Rotation plugin fixes image orientation based on EXIF data. Fixes the mis-oriented images clicked via mobile phones. 

Functionally it filters all uploads and if EXIF->Orientation is set to a number greater than 1, then the image is re-saved with a new orientation before the image is processed by WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How it works? = 
When an image is clicked by a camera or a phone, it stores some additional information about the image. One such information is Orientation. This plugin makes use of the Orientation value stored by the camera/phone and rotates or flips the image based on that.

= Where's the settings page? =
This plugin works out of the box and does not require any settings.

= Can I contribute to the plugin? =
Yes you can. As mentioned in the description, just fork the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/gagan0123/fix-image-rotation), make changes and send pull requests.
You can even contribute by adding banner images and logos for the plugin. If you are familiar with GitHub, then fork the above repo and add the images in a folder named assets, and send pull request; else you can submit URLs to the images as support request.
