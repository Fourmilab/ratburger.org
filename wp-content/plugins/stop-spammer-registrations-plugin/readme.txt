Stop WordPress Spam

== Description ==

Stop spam emails, spam comments, spam registration, and spam bots and spammers in general.

== Installation ==

Go to *Plugins > Add New* from your WP admin menu, search for Stop Spammers, install, and activate.

OR

1. Download the plugin and unzip it.
2. Upload the plugin folder to your wp-content/**plugins** folder.
3. Activate the plugin from the plugins page in the admin.

Either way, Stop Spammers works right out-of-the-box, without needing to adjust any settings. However, if you need it, there are many settings that can be adjusted.
