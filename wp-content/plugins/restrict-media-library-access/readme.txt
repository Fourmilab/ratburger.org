Restricts access for Authors and Contributors so they can only see their own Media Library uploads.

== Description ==
This plugin restricts access for Authors and Contributors so they can only see their own Media Library uploads. 

This has two main uses: Making it easier for Authors to locate their own uploads when Media Libraries grow very big and preventing them from using or downloading media that belongs to other Authors. 

Admins and Editors will still be able to see everyone's uploads. 

== Installation ==
1. Visit Plugins > Add New
2. Search for 'Restrict Media Library Access'
3. Activate Restrict Media Library Access from your Plugins page.
4. That's all!. After activating the plugin Authors and Countributors will only be able to see their own uploads.
