###  WordPress Mail SMTP Plugin

Having problems with your WordPress site not sending emails? You're not alone. Over 1 million websites use WP Mail SMTP to send their emails reliabily.

Our goal is to make email deliverability easy and reliable. We want to ensure your emails reach the inbox.

WP Mail SMTP fixes your email deliverability by reconfiguring WordPress to use a proper SMTP provider when sending emails.

= What is SMTP? =

SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is an industry standard for sending emails. Proper SMTP configuration helps increase email deliverability by using authentication.

Popular email clients like Gmail, Yahoo, and Office 365 are in a constant battle with email spammers. One of the things they look at is if an email is originating from the location it claims to be originating from.

If the proper authentication isn't there, then emails either go in the SPAM folder or worst, don't get delivered at all.

This is a problem for a lot of WordPress sites because by default, WordPress uses the PHP mail function to send emails generated by WordPress or any contact form plugin like <a href="https://wpforms.com/" rel="friend">WPForms</a>.

The issue is that most <a href"http://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-hosting/" rel="friend">WordPress hosting companies</a> don't have their servers properly configured for sending PHP emails.

The combination of two causes your WordPress emails to not get delivered.

= How does WP Mail SMTP work? =

WP Mail SMTP plugin easily resolves email delivery problems by improving and changing how your WordPress site sends email. We reconfigure the `wp_mail()` function to either use proper SMTP host credentials or leverage a built-in SMTP mail provider.

When using one of our built-in SMTP mail provider integrations (recommended), emails are sent using the provider's direct API. This means even if your web host is blocking SMTP ports, your emails still send successfully.

This helps you fix all WordPress not sending email issues.

WP Mail SMTP plugin includes many different SMTP setup options:

1. Mailgun SMTP
2. SendGrid SMTP
3. Gmail SMTP
4. Microsoft SMTP (Outlook.com and Office 365) <a href="https://wpmailsmtp.com/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion&utm_content=readme" rel="friend">[Pro]</a>
5. Amazon SES SMTP <a href="https://wpmailsmtp.com/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion&utm_content=readme" rel="friend">[Pro]</a>
4. All Other SMTP

For all options, you can specify the "from name" and "email address" for outgoing emails.

Instead of having users use different SMTP plugins and workflows for different SMTP providers, we decided to bring it all in one. This is what makes WP Mail SMTP, the best SMTP solution for WordPress.

= Mailgun SMTP =

Mailgun SMTP is a popular SMTP service provider that allows you to send large quantities of emails. They allow you to send your first 10,000 emails for free every month.

WP Mail SMTP plugin offers a native integration with MailGun. All you have to do is connect your Mailgun account, and you will improve your email deliverability.

Read our <a href="https://wpforms.com/how-to-send-wordpress-emails-with-mailgun/" rel="friend">Mailgun documentation</a> for more details.

= Gmail SMTP =

Often bloggers and small business owners don't want to use third-party SMTP services. Well you can use your Gmail or G Suite account for SMTP emails.

This allows you to use your <a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-setup-a-professional-email-address-with-gmail-and-google-apps/" rel="friend">professional email address</a> and improve email deliverability.

Unlike other Gmail SMTP plugins, our Gmail SMTP option uses OAuth to authenticate your Google account, keeping your login information 100% secure.

Read our <a href="https://wpforms.com/how-to-securely-send-wordpress-emails-using-gmail-smtp/" rel="friend">Gmail documentation</a> for more details.

= SendGrid SMTP =

SendGrid has a free SMTP plan that you can use to send up to 100 emails per day. With our native SendGrid SMTP integration, you can easily and securely set up SendGrid SMTP on your WordPress site.

Read our <a href="https://wpforms.com/fix-wordpress-email-notifications-with-sendgrid/" rel="friend">SendGrid documentation</a> for more details.

= Microsoft SMTP (Outlook.com and Office 365) =

Many business use Outlook.com or Office 365 to their to power their email. For those users, the Microsoft mailer can be a great option. This integration allows you to use your existing Outlook.com or Office 365 account to send your emails reliably.

= Amazon SES SMTP =

Advanced or technical users can harness the power of Amazon AWS (Amazon Web Services) with the Amazon SES mailer. With this integration, you can send a high volume of emails at a very reasonable rate.

= Other SMTP =

WP Mail SMTP plugin also works with all major email services such as Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, Microsoft Live, and any other email sending service that offers SMTP.

You can set the following options:

* Specify an SMTP host.
* Specify an SMTP port.
* Choose SSL / TLS encryption.
* Choose to use SMTP authentication or not.
* Specify an SMTP username and password.

= Email Log =

Email Logging lets you log and view all emails sent from your site. Email logs are helpful for storing emails for your records, auditing outgoing emails, and debugging during site development.

= Manage WordPress Emails and Notifications =

The Manage Notification feature gives you full control over which email notifications WordPress sends. This means you can disable different WordPress notification emails. Don't want to receive emails when new users are created? No problem, turn it off.

= Expert Support =

We provide <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/wp-mail-smtp-support-policy/">limited support</a> for the WP Mail SMTP plugin on the WordPress.org forums. Access to our world class one-on-one email support is available to <a href="https://wpmailsmtp.com/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion&utm_content=readme" rel="friend">WP Mail SMTP Pro</a> users.

= White Glove Setup =

Our White Glove Setup service is a great option that anyone can benefit from. Whether you don't have the time or maybe you feel a bit in over your head - we've got you covered.

You can sit back and relax while we set up everything for you. White glove setup includes WP Mail SMTP plugin installation and setup, configuration adjustments to your DNS for proper email domain name verification, Mailgun setup, and final testing to confirm everything is passing with flying colors.

### Security

The WP Mail SMTP team takes security very seriously. Not only does the plugin follow all security best practices, but we have several options available to ensure your site is safe and secure.

- Direct SMTP mailer integrations (recommended), such as Google and Mailgun, use the official provider APIs. This means you never enter your username or password in the plugin settings and these credentials are not stored in the database. Instead, we use tokens or API keys which are much more secure.

- When using Other SMTP mailer, we provide the option to insert your password in your `wp-config.php` file, so it's not visible in your WordPress settings or saved in the database.

### Credits

WP Mail SMTP plugin was originally created by Callum Macdonald. It is now owned and maintained by the team behind <a href="https://wpforms.com/" rel="friend">WPForms</a> - the best drag & drop form builder for WordPress.
