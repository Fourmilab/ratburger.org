Lightweight query for current unread BuddyPress notifications and messages with JSON return.

== Description ==

This plug-in returns, as a JSON data structure, the current BuddyPress
notifications for a logged-in user.  A JavaScript module sends regular
queries and dynamically updates the administration bar's unread
notification and message counts and the notifications drop-down menu.

The plug-in supports standard BuddyPress notifications, the additional
notifications added by the WP ULike plug-in, and local notifications
added for Ratburger.org.
